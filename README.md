the pain27 wasn't painful enough, so i turned it in to a split  
look at it, it's beautiful!  

takes a sparkfun promicro (or clone) and 2x 8 pin + 2-3x 2 pin 2.54mm spacing screw terminal blocks, sure you could put some nice headers and custom make a cable, but this way is ~~worse~~ uh,, better  
you'll also need some M2 screws / standoffs and mx style keyswitches of your choice, i recommend gateron as they're some of the cheapest and you'll regret building this board just a little less  
keycaps? maybe  

***Notice***  
I don't actually recommend getting the pcb produced in it's current state, numerous screw holes interfere with switches, the bottom corners of the switches can be clipped and assembled just fine though i'll get to updating it one day  
Q P M and the left hand 2 port screw terminal are the culprits, feel free to space them out more and PR
